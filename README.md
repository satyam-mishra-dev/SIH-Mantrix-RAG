## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd "RAG MODEL"

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```bash
# Copy the example configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your API keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run the System

```bash
# Run demo
python main.py

# Run web interface
python main.py streamlit

# Run evaluation framework
python main.py evaluate
```

## 📋 Usage

### Web Interface

1. **Fill Student Profile**: Enter age, board, marks, preferred streams, budget, location
2. **Adjust Preferences**: Use sliders to weight different factors (quality, trust, relevance, proximity)
3. **Get Recommendations**: Click "Get Recommendations" to generate AI-powered suggestions
4. **Review Results**: Examine ranked recommendations with detailed explanations and verification status

### API Usage

```python
from src.services.college_recommendation_service import CollegeRecommendationService
from src.models.college import StudentProfile, StreamType, RecommendationRequest

# Initialize service
service = CollegeRecommendationService()

# Create student profile
student = StudentProfile(
    age=18,
    board="CBSE",
    marks_percentage=85.5,
    preferred_streams=[StreamType.ENGINEERING],
    budget_range=(100000, 300000),
    location="Delhi"
)

# Get recommendations
request = RecommendationRequest(student_profile=student)
recommendations = service.get_recommendations(request)
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Settings

- **Embedding Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (default)
- **LLM Model**: `gpt-3.5-turbo` (configurable)
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB with persistent storage

### Verification Sources

- **NIRF**: National Institutional Ranking Framework
- **UGC**: University Grants Commission
- **AICTE**: All India Council for Technical Education
- **DigiLocker**: Official document verification
- **NCS**: National Career Service

### Recommendation Weights

Default scoring weights (customizable):
- **Official Quality**: 30% (accreditation, ranking, reputation)
- **Mentor Trust**: 20% (ratings, reviews)
- **Relevance**: 30% (match to preferences)
- **Proximity**: 20% (location convenience)

## 📊 Evaluation

### Test Cases

The system includes 20 realistic test cases covering:
- High performers (95%+ marks)
- Average performers (70-85% marks)
- Different streams (Engineering, Science, Commerce, Arts, Medical)
- Various budget ranges and locations

### Mentor Validation

Expert mentors can validate recommendations through:
- Quality ratings (1-5 scale)
- Relevance assessment
- Accuracy verification
- Detailed feedback collection

### Metrics

- **Recommendation Quality**: Composite score analysis
- **Relevance**: Stream alignment and preference matching
- **Verification Accuracy**: Claim validation success rate
- **Budget Compliance**: Adherence to financial constraints

## 🔍 Verification Process

1. **Claim Extraction**: Identify key claims about colleges
2. **Source Querying**: Check against government databases
3. **Evidence Matching**: Compare claims with official data
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Rate verification reliability
5. **Status Assignment**: Mark as verified, flagged, or pending
